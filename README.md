Project 4 for Udacity Full Stack Web Dev Nanodegree

Session and Speaker Design Response:
Session class is going to have the required fields of name, highlights, speaker, duration, typeOfSession, date, and start time

In the SessionForm class there are also websafe_key and websafe_conference_id fields. The websafe_key field is used to {---INSERT REASON---}. The websafe_conference_id field is used to identify which conference the session belongs to.

The two additional query types I've decided to add are finding sessions starting before or after a certain time, and sessions with duration less than or more than a certain amount. These would allow the user to plan there schedule accordingly.
